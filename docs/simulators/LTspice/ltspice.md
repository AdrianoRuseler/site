## LTspice® Demo Circuits

LTspice provides macromodels for most of Analog Devices’ switching regulators, linear regulators, and amplifiers, as well as a library of devices for general circuit simulation. Select Analog Devices products also have demonstration circuits available for free download. These demo circuits are designed to ensure proper performance and have been reviewed by Analog Devices’ factory applications group. Follow the instructions below to run the demo circuits in LTspice.
