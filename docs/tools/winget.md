Use WinGet to install and manage applications

WinGet is a command line tool enabling users to discover, install, upgrade, remove and configure applications on Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2025 computers. This tool is the client interface to the Windows Package Manager service.

```bash
winget list
```

To upgrade all packages using WinGet while excluding a specific one, you need to use the winget pin command.

Pin the app you want to exclude

```bash
winget pin add --id <Package.ID>
```

Run the global upgrade

```bash
winget upgrade --all
```

Remove the pin later

```bash
winget pin remove --id <Package.ID>
```
